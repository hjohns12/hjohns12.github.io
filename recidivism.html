    <h2>Body Cameras and Civilian Race in Police Shootings</h2>
    <p>> <a href="https://github.com/hjohns12/NYPD-disciplinary-proceedings" target=_blank>View Code</a></p>
    <p>> Paper available upon request</a></p>
    <p>Body cameras have been rapidly prioritized, funded, and diffused in an effort to increase transparency and reduce the use of excessive force in policing. Specifying generalized linear models, I examine
the use of body cameras in officer-involved shootings spanning 2015-2016. I analyze if
there exists differential deployment of BWCs with respect to (1) civilian race and
(2) whether the civilian was armed when fatally shot. I find that Hispanics were
fatally shot by officers without activated cameras at a disproportionately high rate
compared to other groups. I also find that unarmed civilians were more likely
than armed civilians to have been fatally shot by an officer wearing a body camera
during the fatal encounter. I conclude that whatever criteria the police used to
deploy BWCs produced a disparate impact on the basis of a civilian's race and
armed status.</p>
